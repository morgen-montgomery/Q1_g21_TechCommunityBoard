The "Tech Community Board" was my first personal project during Q1 of Galvanize's full-stack immersive.  The project is front-end focused and acts as a simple posting board for women in tech that are looking for mentorship or who wish to be mentors.

I have always been driven by networking and growing my personal network.  Having only been in Seattle for a month when this project was given to us, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to show this off.  Another aspect of networking that really drives me is the opportunity for women to support other women, especially in the STEM fields.  The objective of 'TCB' is to bring women new to the technology field in contact with women who have established careers and networks by pairing them together based on mutual interests and goals, creating a safe space for mentorship and exploration in a previously male-dominated field.
